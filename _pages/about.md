I am Michael Etienne Van Huffel, a recent graduate from the [Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule of Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), where I earned a Master’s degree in Mathematics (Statistics) this winter. Before that, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, also at ETH. My academic interests encompass diverse topics such as autonomous systems, large-scale optimization, statistical learning theory, model predictive control, trustworthy artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, dynamical systems, and high-dimensional statistics.

Throughout my academic journey, I have had the opportunity to engage in various projects that have contributed to my growth and understanding of these fields, including completing my master thesis in exchange at Imperial College. In addition, I have worked as a teaching assistant for several semesters, where I had the opportunity to share my knowledge and support fellow students in their studies.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I lead an active lifestyle. In my free time, I enjoy powerbuilding training, bouldering, and engaging in board and video games. I also have a passion for skiing during the winter months and indulge in extreme sports such as downhill mountain biking during the summer. It won't be hard for you to find me the gym in the Hönggerberg campus, particularly in the evenings. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me. I welcome opportunities to collaborate and engage in discussions related to my academic pursuits and shared hobbies.
