I am Michael Etienne Van Huffel, a recent graduate of ETH Zurich (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule), where I earned a Master’s degree in Statistics. Before that, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, also at ETH.  I am currently an incoming research intern at the [Computational Applied Mathematics & AI Lab](https://camail.org) at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems. During my studies, I was also a visiting graduate student researcher at Imperial College London, where I completed my master’s thesis.

I am broadly interested in diverse topics such as statistical learning theory, autonomous systems, reinforcement learning, computational topology, natural language processing, and deep learning.

Outside academia, I'm passionate about powerbuilding, climbing, trekking, skiing and downhill. I also enjoy traveling, reading, playing chess, and photography. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me. I welcome opportunities to collaborate and engage in discussions related to research and shared interests.
